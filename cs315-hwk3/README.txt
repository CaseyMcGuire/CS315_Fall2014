Casey McGuire



/**********************************************************************
* What is the inspiration for your robot?
***********************************************************************/

None.



/**********************************************************************
* Did you complete any extensions to this assignment? If so, what?
***********************************************************************/

Yes, I did arcball rotation instead of trackball rotation.



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did you spend working on this assignment?
***********************************************************************/

10- 15 hours.



/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

-Getting the robot modeled was a lot more challenging than I thought it
would be.

-Getting jQuery to work as described was also challenging. I was
able to do it since I have some background in HTML and CSS though I would 
imagine someone who didn't have such background would've found this part of the
assignment very difficult.

I feel that I have a much better understanding of how matrices are used to
manipulate images.
