-I spend quite a bit of time trying to get my triangle to shade correctly.It tended to be show up very dark and I couldn't figure out why. It turns out that the unit normal was pointing the wrong way and if I took its negative it shaded correctly. It might be a good idea to warn students that if their colors aren't showing up correctly and their algorithm looks correct, they might try changing the direction of their normals.
