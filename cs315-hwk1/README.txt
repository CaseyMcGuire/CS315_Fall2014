Casey McGuire



/**********************************************************************
* What browser and operating system did you test your program with?
***********************************************************************/

I tested my program with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on both Ubuntu 
and OSX.



/**********************************************************************
* What is the data set you included? Where is the data from?
***********************************************************************/

The data set I included is the market capitalization of various technology
firms at the close of trading on Friday September 12th, 2014. I got the data
from Google Finance.


/**********************************************************************
* Based on your program, briefly describe when you think it would be
* appropriate to use each kind of graph. For example, why would you
* use a pie graph instead of a line graph?
***********************************************************************/

A pie graph would be more appropriate when you want to compare
the relative values of your data points. 

A line graph would be more appropriate when you want to compare 
the value of something over time. 

A bar graph would be more appropriate when you want to compare data 
points both on a relative *and* a absolute basis.



/**********************************************************************
* Did you complete any extensions to this assignment? If so, what?
***********************************************************************/

Yes, I added a linear gradient to the bar graph and a radial gradient to the
pie graph.



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did you spend working on this assignment?
***********************************************************************/

Maybe 15 but I'm not completely sure.



/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

 -It should be clear in the specs that the pie graph needs labels. 
 -I couldn't work on the assignment for a couple of days because my
 webpage wouldn't render. I thought it was an issue with the webserver
but as it turned out it was because I had an infinite loop in my Javascript 
code. It might be helpful in the future to let people know if their page
isn't rendering, that might be why.





/**********************************************************************

 * doing the assignment, whether you enjoyed doing it, etc.
 **********************************************************************/

-I really enjoyed this assignment. Javascript is new to me and I feel like
I have a *much* better grasp on it than I did less than two weeks ago. Its 
much easier to learn a new language by doing a time-consuming 
assignment like this than it is read books, watch lectures, or do small
problems in textbooks.
