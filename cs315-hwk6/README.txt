I had quite a few problems with this assignment, as did many others it seems.
-Considering the difficulty of the last assignment and the fact that we had
to build off of it for this assignment, giving us only a little over a week
to finish seemed overly ambitious. If repeating this assignment,
I think giving more time and warning students to start (and seek help!) early 
would be helpful.
-Debugging the shaders was extremely difficult as I couldn't figure out the 
state of each variable.

This assignment is partly done. I could only get the ground textured correctly.
The ground and house seem to be lighted decently otherwise. Considering how long
I worked on this assignment and how unfinished it is, I'm not satisfied with this submission but I can't delay turning it in anymore.
